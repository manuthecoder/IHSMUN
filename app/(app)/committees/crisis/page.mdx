    # Crisis committee
    
    What is the Joint Crisis Committee?
    The IHSIMUN Two-Room JCC is an exhilarating aspect of MUN conferences that offers participants a unique, dynamic experience. Unlike standard MUN committees that follow set agendas and resolutions, crisis committees immerse delegates in fast-paced, unpredictable situations requiring quick thinking, strategy, and creative problem-solving.

    Korean Airlines 007, otherwise known as KAL007 was a symbol of Cold War tensions, tragically shot down by Soviet forces in 1983, representing the high-stakes conflict between superpowers and the devastating human cost of geopolitical strife. Its destruction served as an unsettling reminder of the fragility of peace and the disastrous results of misunderstandings and military paranoia. 
    Ultimately, it is up to you, whether to negotiate for peace, or to seek total war. We are approaching a cornerstone in the history of our time, and path the future takes is in your hands.

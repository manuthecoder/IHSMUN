    # Fees & Payments
**Comprehensive Financial Information:**  
The goal of the IHSIMUN Executive Board is to make our conference as approachable and affordable as possible. Our delegate fees remain among the lowest in Southern California, and fee waivers are also offered if finances are of concern.

  
### **Your Delegate Fees:**

| Middle School Delegate Fee  | $15.00 |
| :---- | :---- |
| **High School Delegate Fee**  | $25.00 |
| **Delegation Fee** | $30.00 |
| **Drop Fee (\> 10 Delegates Dropped)** | $62.50\*\* |
<br/>

### **Drop Fees:**  
We completely understand that delegates sometimes have priorities that interfere with attending an MUN Conference. However, mass drops are ***difficult and costly*** for the conference staff to manage. As a result, we have introduced a “drop fee”, where if ***more than 10 delegates*** are dropped from a team, ***you are still held accountable for 25% of each dropped delegate’s fee***. For 10 delegates, this is $62.50, and adds on in $6.25 increments. However, we do not anticipate invoking this policy but ensure that you register somewhat accurately.
<br/>
### **Cash or Check?**  
The policy differs by delegation size. Small delegations with less than 5 delegates can pay via cash on the day of the conference. However, larger delegations must send in a check by the October 10th deadline. We can take cash payments at check in on the morning of the conference. There will be a designated check in right outside of the theater.
<br/>

### **Transportation and Communication**  
We do not anticipate that many schools will request transportation accommodations, however, if you school requires transportation, please email us at least one month in advance so that we can guide you to IUSD’s transportation services for buses, air travel, and further transport. Your transportation services will most likely be paid to the Irvine Unified School District, not IHSMUN, as requested. We do not anticipate many schools requesting transportation services, but we are happy to assist and guide you as your team needs.

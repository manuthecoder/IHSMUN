# About us

Model United Nations is an academic club for students to discuss issues the UN faces with a mock conference. After conducting research about a given topic, students will represent a country in a committee that represents real committees in the UN. At conferences, they will discuss current world issues with their peers and try to push policies and pass resolutions to ultimately solve the issue.

    ### Secretary General 
    ##### Ishaan Gaikwad
    <br />
    Ishaan first joined MUN in middle school and has been a passionate delegate ever since. He first joined the club to express his interests in geography and politics. Through participating, Ishaan credits MUN for improving his public speaking and interpersonal communication, as well as leaving him more informed and conscious of world affairs. With a particular liking for specialized committees, he has served on IHSMUNâ€™s board for the past 2 years, and is excited to welcome delegates for the Irvine Invitational conference this October.

    Hello! I'm Sriram Vaidhyanathan and I'm your Under Secretary General for this year's Irvine High School Invitational MUN Conference!

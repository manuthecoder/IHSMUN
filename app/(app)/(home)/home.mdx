# Welcome letter from the secretary general
I am Sriram Vaidhyanathan, the proud Secretary General of the Irvine High School Invitational Model United Nations Conference. It is my distinguished honor and utmost pleasure to welcome you all to Irvine High School this November!
<br />
This year, we celebrate three significant milestones simultaneously. The Irvine High School Model United Nations team celebrates 15 years of debate, Irvine High School Commemorates it’s 50th anniversary since it’s founding in 1975, and the United Nations turns 80 on this year’s United Nations Day. 
<br />
In this light, our theme, Can you Forge the Next Golden Age?, celebrates the strategic decisions that built the world’s greatest empires, from diplomatic treatises to complex trade agreements, from the Silk Road to the modern United Nations. They all converged to create waves of peace and prosperity for all citizens, a period that historians call a “Golden Age.”
<br />
My journey with Model United Nations began in eighth grade, when I didn’t have the opportunity to attend conferences and interact with delegates across Irvine, which amplified my fear of speaking in public. Through my high school years, I seized the opportunity to attend MUN conferences, participating and achieving in numerous conferences, and now creating a conference for you all to develop your public speaking and negotiation abilities.
<br />
There’s no doubt about the power of Model United Nations to transform your life, to overcome your fears and face the unknown. No matter what, whether it be a new committee with new insight, or your very first conference, the Irvine Invitational is here for you to build your diplomacy, peacebuilding, and negotiation skills. We strive not only to provide a quality conference but to surpass, innovate, and expand the scope of the Irvine Invitational like never before!
<br />
Take this November’s conference as a chance for you to build a better world for the people around you, and to bring light through your diplomacy. The decisions that are made today impact tomorrow’s future, and even despite the turmoils and tensions in our world, I believe that our future is ours to create.
<br />
On behalf of my entire staff and secretariat, the doors of the second iteration of the Irvine High School Invitational are now open, and it’s now your turn to forge the next golden age!
<br />
Yours in service,

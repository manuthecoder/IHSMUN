# About us

Model United Nations is an academic club for students to discuss issues the UN faces with a mock conference. After conducting research about a given topic, students will represent a country in a committee that represents real committees in the UN. At conferences, they will discuss current world issues with their peers and try to push policies and pass resolutions to ultimately solve the issue.

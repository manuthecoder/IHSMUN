# Welcome letter from the secretary general
I am Ishaan Gaikwad, and it is my distinguished honor to serve as your Secretary-General for this year’s edition of the Irvine High Invitational MUN Conference. Ever since joining MUN at the middle school level nearly 6 years ago, I have been enamored with its unique and powerful role in educating the next generation in international relations and affairs. However, Model UN is also a catalyst to overcome public speaking inhibitions, hone oratory and debate skills, and above all develop connections with like-minded peers. With a dedicated team of conference staff, board members, and advisors, we hope that IHSIMUNC engenders these experiences and is a positive force in your MUN careers. We are committed to fostering constructive debate and providing every delegate with the room and opportunities to grow.
<br />
From first-time delegates to seasoned debaters, IHSIMUNC aims to provide every delegate with a fulfilling and stimulating debate experience to begin this school year’s MUN season. Our committee options, currently in the works, will offer delegates the chance to expand their horizons, debating globally relevant issues in a diverse selection of committees and bodies. We hope that the topics and debates you encounter in IHSIMUNC leave you searching for more and sparks a passion for global affairs, just as I’ve experienced in conferences past.
<br />
The entire Irvine High MUN board wishes you an excellent conference experience, and hopes to welcome your delegation to our school this October!
<br />
Cordially,

    ### Secretary General 
    ##### Ishaan Gaikwad
    <br />
    Ishaan first joined MUN in middle school and has been a passionate delegate ever since. He first joined the club to express his interests in geography and politics. Through participating, Ishaan credits MUN for improving his public speaking and interpersonal communication, as well as leaving him more informed and conscious of world affairs. With a particular liking for specialized committees, he has served on IHSMUN’s board for the past 2 years, and is excited to welcome delegates for the Irvine Invitational conference this October.
